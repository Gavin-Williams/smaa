1. How to use it
==========================

Best thing to do is to checkout the demo app (SMAADemo.sln). SMAA.cs
contains the main SMAA code along with some documentation.

Since XNA requires all effects to be precompiled, there are separate
shaders for all SMAA quality stages in the shaders/ folder. To be 
able to switch quality at runtime, all shaders need to be added
to the content pipeline. Make sure to set the "Optimize" flag in
the settings of the effects to avoid breaking the 512 instruction 
limit for SM 3.0 shaders.

Additionally, two lookup textures are needed by SMAA:

- textures/AreaTexDX9.dds
- textures/SearchTex.dds

Both need to be configured as follows: no Mips, no Color Keying,
no Premultiplied Alpha, no DXT Compression.

That's it.


2. XBox 360 Performance
==========================

Since SMAA expects the scene as input, a full resolve pass from the
EDRAM to main memory is needed. This is typically a main bottleneck
in XBox 360 renderers, so better expect XBox 360 performance 
degradation to be worse than on PC (it is definitely the case
in my measurements but your mileage may, of course, vary).


3. Known Issues
==========================

- XNA is based on a sub DX9 feature level in which linear filtering
  on floating point textures is not supported, even if the hardware
  is capable of doit it (which is the case for most hardware in
  use today). For this reason, some of the input textures filters
  have been changed from LINEAR to POINT to support SMAA on 
  floating-point targets (such as from HDR rendering). Probably
  this should be made a preprocessor define instead since LINEAR
  would be fine for non-floating-point targets.

- This code has been used in multiple XBox Live Indie Games
  on the XBox 360, but is far away from being super well-tested. 
  Use at your own risk, see the license section for more information.
